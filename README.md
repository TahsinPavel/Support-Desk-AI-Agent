# For Neon Database
Key points:
- Tenant / Client model (called Tenant) is the owner of channels, KB, messages, etc.
- User model exists for tenant admins/operators (separate from tenant record).
- All channel/message/knowledge/escalation/etc. tables reference tenant_id.
- Use Alembic to generate migrations against Neon. Do NOT run create_all() blindly in prod.

# For Running migration 

- alembic revision -m "migration_commit_message" (in the created file, write the migration code)
- alembic upgrade head

# Run Fast Api 
- uvicorn main:app --reload
